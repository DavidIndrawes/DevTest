This is the solution for the GoEuro recruitment test, the application is to take a city name and retrieve data about this city from the goeuro API and then save this data in a CSV file in the same directory, the file name will be same as the city name, to use the application you need to download the .jar file https://github.com/DavidIndrawes/DevTest/blob/master/DevTest/GoEuro.jar
Then use the terminal to run the application passing the city name as the a parameter, the command should be like that: 

java -jar GoEuro.jar "CITY_NAME"

Ex: java -jar GoEuro.jar paris
